# Cross Compiling
When using a cross compiler certain header files and libraries from the RaspberryPi need to be copied to your development system. For convenience these are included in this folder. 

Note that the files provided here maybe outdated by the time you download them. These files may also be found on your RasPi in the following locations:  
`/usr/include/mysql/`  
`/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/`  
`/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf`
